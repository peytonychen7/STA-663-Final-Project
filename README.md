# STA-663-Final-Project

Students: Raghav Agrawal, Peyton Chen

In our term final project for STA 663 - Statistical Computation, we studied the paper titled "Infinite Latent Feature Models
and the Indian Buffet Process" by Thomas L. Griffiths and Zoubin Ghahramani and implememented the algorithms described in the paper.

The `Package` directory contains all the files in our package, which includes the source code. To install the package, use `python3 -m pip install STA-663-IBP`. To import the sampler from the package, run `from IBP_Sampler_Package.IBP_Sampler import IBP, log_likelyhood, sampler`.

The test codes are located in the `Test code` folder. 

Examples of the implementation of our algorithms can be found in the `Example` directory. 

The final report is in the main repository.

`IBP_Sampler_w_Desc.ipynb` walks through each of the functions and their purpose
